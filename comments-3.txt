__label__corrective "bug 10094: The problem was we added code that won't add any more ha work items if it already has one.  However  that is wrong.  HA Manager stores the existing snapshot of the VM state machine.  Before working on HA for a VM  it checks to see if that snapshot has been changed.  So by not scheduling HA work  we've effectively made HA not work under multi-failure situations.  I've fixed by removing that code and instead at the time of performing HA  do a quick check to see if there are pwork underway for the same VM and work scheduled in the future for that VM.  If there are work scheduled in the future  then we simply cancel the current work.  If there are already work underway  then we retry again in 1 minute."

__label__corrective "CS-16544: Create Snapshot (2nd time - reccuring) is failing on XenServer 6.1. The issue is that while backing up a snapshot when cloudstack tries to update the parent (of the backed up vhd)  vhd-util isn't present at the desired location and setParent function in vmopsSnapshot fails. This issue is observed only on Xenserver 6.1. The reason for this is  when to a Xenserver and executes the SetupCommand  it copies vhd-util tool to /opt/xensource/bin directory on the host. However  in vmopsSnapshot python file 'VHD_UTIL' is initialized to /usr/sbin/. The issue is not observed on 6.0.2 (and I guess previous versions) because vhd-util is present in /usr/sbin/ directory by default (after a clean install). Whereas  in Xenserver 6.1  vhd-util is present in '/usr/bin'. Fixed the issue by updating VHD_UTIL to point to /opt/xensource/bin/vhd-util in vmopsSnapshot file."

Think about it.  Why would anyone want to call one dao function  switch transaction  and then switch back.  The right thing is for the caller to switch transaction  call a series of dao codes  and switch it back.  That's the semantics I changed to.

__label__adaptive "Implement reading from null safe dereferences

Null safe dereferences make handling null or missing values shorter.
Compare without:
```
if (ctx._source.missing != null && ctx._source.missing.foo != null) {
  ctx._source.foo_length = ctx.source.missing.foo.length()
}
```

To with:
```
Integer length = ctx._source.missing?.foo?.length();
if (length != null) {
  ctx._source.foo_length = length
}
```

Combining this with the as of yet unimplemented elvis operator allows
for very concise defaults for nulls:
```
ctx._source.foo_length = ctx._source.missing?.foo?.length() ?: 0;
```

Since you have to start somewhere  we started with null safe dereferenes.

Anyway  this is a feature borrowed from groovy. Groovy allows writing to
null values like:
```
def v = null
v?.field = 'cat'
```
And the writes are simply ignored. Painless doesn't support this at this
point because it'd be complex to implement and maybe not all that useful.

There is no runtime cost for this feature if it is not used. When it is
used we implement it fairly efficiently  adding a jump rather than a
temporary variable.

This should also work fairly well with doc values."

So by not scheduling HA work  we've effectively made HA not work under multi-failure situations.  I've fixed by removing that code and instead at the time of performing HA  do a quick check to see if there are pwork underway for the same VM and work scheduled in the future for that VM.  If there are work scheduled in the future  then we simply cancel the current work.  If there are already work underway  then we retry again in 1 minute."

__label__adaptive "Set available processors for Netty

Netty uses the number of processors for sizing various resources (e.g. 
thread pools  buffer pools  etc.). However  it uses the runtime number
of available processors which might not match the configured number of
processors as set in Elasticsearch to limit the number of threads (for
example  in Docker containers). A new feature was added to Netty that
enables configuring the number of processors Netty should see for sizing
this various resources. This commit takes advantage of this feature to
set this number of available processors to be equal to the configured
number of processors set in Elasticsearch.

This reindex has all of the features of local reindex:
* Using queries to filter what is copied
* Retry on rejection
* Throttle/rethottle
The big advantage of this version is that it goes over the HTTP API
which can be made backwards compatible.

Some things are different:

The query field is sent directly to the other node rather than parsed
on the coordinating node. This should allow it to support constructs
that are invalid on the coordinating node but are valid on the target
node. Mostly  that means old syntax."

__label__adaptive "percolator: Replace percolate api with the new percolator query

Also replaced the PercolatorQueryRegistry with the new PercolatorQueryCache.

The PercolatorFieldMapper stores the rewritten form of each percolator query's xcontext
in a binary doc values field. This make sure that the query rewrite happens only during
indexing (some queries for example fetch shapes  terms in remote indices) and
the speed up the loading of the queries in the percolator query cache.

Because the percolator now works inside the search infrastructure a number of features
(sorting fields  pagination  fetch features) are available out of the box.

The following feature requests are automatically implemented via this refactoring:

Closes #10741
Closes #7297
Closes #13176
Closes #13978

Think about it.  Why would anyone want to call one dao function  switch transaction  and then switch back when it fails.  The right thing is for the caller to switch transaction  call a series of dao codes  and switch it back in case it is invalid.  That's the semantics I changed to.

The shards preference on a search request enables specifying a list of
shards to hit  and then a secondary preference (e.g.  ""_primary"") can be

preference is ';'. Unfortunately  this is also a valid separtor for URL
query parameters. This means that a preference like ""_shards:0;_primary""
will be parsed into two URL parameters: ""_shards:0"" and ""_primary"". With
the recent change to strict URL parsing  the second parameter will be
rejected  ""_primary"" is not a valid URL parameter on a search
request. This means that this feature has never worked (unless the ';'
is escaped  but no one does that because our docs do not that  and there
was no indication from Elasticsearch that this did not work). This
commit changes the separator to '|'.

If the thread pools of an elasticsearch node cannot be shutdown

in an unclean shutdown - not from an elasticsearch point of view

around.

In order to prevent this the init script as well as the systemd

One reason for this feature is the possibility to change pre built

__label__adaptive "Enable validation of Optional values

To validate values contained in an `Optional` type  we need to use a new
feature in Hibernate Validator 5.1  so this introduces a dependency
version bump to 5.1.1.

This makes use of an *experimental* feature in Hibernate Validator  so
I'm not 100% sure we'll want to make use of it yet.

To validate the contents of an `Optional`  you need to include an
`@UnwrapValidatedValue` annotation on the property being validated:

```java
@Length(min = 32  max = 32)
@UnwrapValidatedValue
private Optional<String> md5 = Optional.absent();
```

Absent values are considered `null` when validated  so their behaviour
depends on your chosen constraints' handling of `null` values.

We have to register this inside `Bootstrap`  and I noticed that we don't
(currently) expose a way for users to register more validation behaviour
through `Bootstrap`  so we should probably look in to that."

When I originally wrote the transform feature I didn't think that the

This revision changes the transform feature from always reencoding with smile
to always reencoding with the provided XContentType to support the completion
suggester.

__label__perfective Rather than blindly remove hydrogens we now only remove hydrogens we can accurately represent as implicit. Previously with molecular hydrogen an empty structure was returned - molecular hydrogen is now preserved. This makes more sense as we can then convert to/from explicit hydrogen without losing atoms - an empty structure definitely doesn’t represent molecular hydrogen and so ‘add explicit hydrogens’ would not put back in the correct number of atoms.

__label__perfective "The libs have been removed from the repository to avoid increasing its size (a README file has been added with instructions on how to obtain the necessary JDT libs). JDX now uses a smarter structure to store source code (i.e.  it is no more duplicated inside types and methods - instead  they recover their source code from the compilation unit's source code). This makes the DependencyReport much more lightweight. Type equal's method now checks for their parent compilation unit. Only a single source directory is now alloed (simplifies model). Method have a new attribute that holds its javadoc. Other smaller changes here and there (but no changes to the dependency extraction itself)"
